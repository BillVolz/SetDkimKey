# SetDkimKey
This sample allows you to add or change and DKIM key using the MTA's web services.

Since the DKIM private key is encrypted on the server you must encrypt the key before using the Account Settings API.

The Web Service help file can be found in the MTA's install directory  \Hurricane MTA Server\docs\WebServices.chm
